# Introduction

New Scala is a new platform for the Scala language that supports the JVM and Scala.js runtimes.

The major motivation behind it is, indeed, because:

- SBT or Maven require complex configuration with tendency to yield errors
- SBT or Maven complicate publishing to the registry (like the Maven Central)
- Scala Metals is a bit chaotic (it uses multiple hidden directories under the project root)
- New Scala gets the opportunity to implement certain features others are not able to (like embedding resources in a way similar to Vite.js and Turbopack)

> **Note**: New Scala's development has not began yet.
